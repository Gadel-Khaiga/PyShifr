# PyShifr

This is my first project for which I made a user interface using PYQT5.

My main task was to encrypt and decipher the word using Caesar's method.
This method assumes the permutation of words by a symbol located at some constant number of positions to the left or to the right of it in the alphabet.

But instead of a simple alphabet, I used unicode, since I was too lazy to make an array from the alphabet, and I confess honestly with unicode the cipher turns out to be more interesting, for example, I can shift the text by 222 characters and get an alien language)
